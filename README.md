There are a lot of useful books, guides, technical documentation, research papers, code examples and testimonials available online. You are merely a Google search away from this stuff, provided you weed out the SEO-optimised content mill pages, which still rank high on Google.
# Android
[Google Android Developer Training](https://developer.android.com/guide) is the obvious place to start. It offers a lot of useful resources, best practices and so on.
[Free Android Programming Guide For Begginers](https://www.eduonix.com/offers/Android_ebook_free_offer.html#.VchB3vmqpBc) is a ten-chapter course covering the basics of Android development.
Tuturials Point’s [Android Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/android/android_tutorial.pdf) is another tutorial for green developers. It also includes a number of code examples that may be useful for novices.
Coreservlets also offers a number of [Android tutorials](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/android-tutorial/) covering a wide range of topics. This is not a print book, so the online collection is expanded and updated from time to time.
If you are looking for free design advice, you should check out [Styling Android](https://blog.stylingandroid.com/). This is not a proper book, either, so the content is updated on a regular basis.

I should note that most Android tutorials, and virtually all books, assume that you already know your way around Java. In case you don’t, you will have to start there before moving on to these Android resources.

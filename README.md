# free_programming_ebooks
There are a lot of useful books, guides, technical documentation, research papers, code examples and testimonials available online. You are merely a Google search away from this stuff, provided you weed out the SEO-optimised content mill pages, which still rank high on Google.
# Android
[Google Android Developer Training](https://developer.android.com/guide) is the obvious place to start. It offers a lot of useful resources, best practices and so on.
[Free Android Programming Guide For Begginers](https://www.eduonix.com/offers/Android_ebook_free_offer.html#.VchB3vmqpBc) is a ten-chapter course covering the basics of Android development.
Tuturials Point’s [Android Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/android/android_tutorial.pdf) is another tutorial for green developers. It also includes a number of code examples that may be useful for novices.
Coreservlets also offers a number of [Android tutorials](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/android-tutorial/) covering a wide range of topics. This is not a print book, so the online collection is expanded and updated from time to time.
If you are looking for free design advice, you should check out [Styling Android](https://blog.stylingandroid.com/). This is not a proper book, either, so the content is updated on a regular basis.

I should note that most Android tutorials, and virtually all books, assume that you already know your way around Java. In case you don’t, you will have to start there before moving on to these Android resources.
# C Sharp, C, C++
The Beginner’s Guide to C# and the .NET Micro Framework is a relatively recent publication by GHI Electronics. It is a brief, but concise, guide that should help you get started.
The[ C# Programming Yellow Book](http://www.csharpcourse.com/) is published by the University of Hull and, since it’s part of the university’s courses, the book is updated on a regular basis.
For more specific information you can turn to[ Data Structures and Algorithms](https://freecomputerbooks.com/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-with-Object-Oriented-Design-Patterns-in-C-Sharp.html) with Object-Oriented Design Patterns in C#. You should also check out Joseph Albahari’s [Threading in C#](https://www.albahari.com/threading/)
Since C and C++ have been around for a while, there is a lot more to choose from, but many of these resources are out of date, or just plain bad. If you are looking for C++ books and tutorials, I suggest you check out this[ Stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list) and find something good. I should note that not all of these books are free.
As for C, you could check out the [C Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming), [Deep C and C++](https://www.slideshare.net/olvemaudal/deep-c), and[ Learn C ](https://learncodethehardway.org/c/)The Hard Way
# Git
If you are not sure whether Git is right for you, Version Control by Example will help you decide between Apache Subversion, Mercurial, Git, and Veracity.
Stanford’s[ Git Magic](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/gitmagic/) is another quality resource, and unlike most books in our list, it is available in a range of languages, including Chinese, French, Italian, Polish and Russian.
The[ GitHub Cheat Sheet ](https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet)is a useful collection of hidden features and power user tips for Git and GitHub.
# HTML and CSS
Many authors choose to cover HTML and CSS in a single publication, so I will list both.

The[ Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html) is a great place to learn more about best practices. The guide contains a myriad of rules governing HTML and CSS style, formatting, meta and more.
Shay Howe’s[ Learn to Code HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/), and Learn to Code [Advanced HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/) are two straightforward guides with different learning curves, making them suitable for people looking to learn the basics, or expand their skill set with some advanced techniques.
If you are familiar with HTML, but need to update your skills, [Dive Into HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.info/) is a good choice. The focus is on moving to HTML5 and utilising new features, plus, you might appreciate Mark Pilgrim’s style. Other HTML5 resources include [HTML5 Canvas](https://www.oreilly.com/), HTML5 For Web Designers and HTML5 for Publishers.
# iOS
Five years ago, Apple published six free ebooks for iOS developers: Cocoa Fundamental’s Guide, The Objective-C Programming Language, iOS Application Programming Guide, Object Oriented Programming With Objective-C, iOS Technology Overview, and iOS Human Interface Guidelines. The books were freely distributed via the iBookstore. Apple also offers additional resources for developers new to iOS, such as Start Developing iOS Apps Today.

iOS Succinctly from Syncfusion comes highly recommended, as does iOS 8 App Development Essentials by Techotopia.

With the introduction of Swift, Apple published a comprehensive, 500-page book, covering the new programming language. The title is not very imaginative: The Swift Programming Language.

# Java
If you are into Java or JavaScript, you can consider yourself lucky, because there are dozens of good, freely distributed books you can use. In fact, there are so many that I’ve decided not to list most of them, because this post would end up looking like a Java 101 class.

Bruce Eckel’s Thinking in Java stands out and comes highly recommended.

Google’s Java Style Guide is a must-read for novices and veterans alike.

Moving on to another tech giant, Sun’s Java Tutorials is another compilation of useful Java stuff.

Introduction to Programming in Java is a Princeton textbook, so if you could not afford an Ivy League education, you can at least use the same syllabus. It is also worth noting that many universities around the world offer similar textbooks, which may come in handy if you are not a native English speaker.

# JavaScript
As I said, dozens of different JavaScript books, tutorials and code repositories are available online, so I will narrow my list down to just a few titles.

Addy Osmani’s Learning JavaScript Design Patterns is all about streamlining the learning process and making JS patterns easier to understand.

Another O’Rilley publication, Programming JavaScript Applications by Eric Elliott, is also available for free in HTML format.

The Google JavaScript Style Guide should also come in handy.

# PHP
Since PHP has been around for ages, there’s no shortage of free books and other resources. However, many of them are out of date (although they can still be useful if you are just grappling with the basics).

Hacking With PHP (formerly Practical PHP Programming) is a frequently updated resource, and in its latest incarnation, has a lot of fresh info on PHP 5.6.

PHP Best Practices is self-explanatory and updated on a regular basis.

If you’re looking for something that offers everything in one place, the PHP Programming Wikibook could be what you’re after.

If you are using a framework such as Laravel, you can still find some useful freebies, namely official documentation.

# Perl
Impatient Perl by Greg London is a quick reference guide. It’s useful for developers who are just getting started, but can also be used as reference by seasoned developers.

Modern Perl is a relatively recent publication, so it’s ideal for developers who have some Perl experience, but need to refresh their skill set.

O’Rilley’s Mastering Perl isn’t the most recent Perl publication, but it is still a good resource with plenty of tutorials.

# Python
Python developers are a lucky bunch because they can choose from dozens of free books. This causes a problem because I can’t list nearly enough in this article. There are a number of publications for novices and battle-hardened veterans, as well as some very specific niche stuff. Still, there are a few obvious choices, such as Google’s Python publications.

Google offers a complete Python Class, as well as the Python Style Guide.

New Mexico Tech offers a straightforward guide to commonly used Python features, which could be a time-saver for green developers.

Dive Into Python 3 by Mark Pilgrim is all about moving to Python 3.x, so it’s a good choice for developers who need to brush up their skills.

# Ruby and Ruby on Rails
Ruby and Ruby on Rails are the weapon of choice for many developers, hence there is no shortage of books and user guides.

Learn Ruby The Hard Way is a collection of excercises, so it takes a practical approach to learning.

The Ruby Style Guide, hosted on GitHub, documents the style and best practices.

Ruby in 20 Minutes is a small Ruby tutorial designed for novice users who need a bit of hand-holding.

Ruby on Rails Style Guide is another GitHub guide focused on style and best practices.

Ruby on Rails 4.0 Guide is a comprehensive guide covering most aspects of RoR 4.0.

Learn Ruby on Rails as You Modify a Craigslist Clone is a practical tutorial. It can be used by green developers, as well as those with a background in Rails.
